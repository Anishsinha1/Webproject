   Bangalore (/bæŋɡəˈlɔːr/), officially Bengaluru (Kannada pronunciation:
[ˈbeŋgɐɭuːɾu] (listen)), is the capital and largest city of the 
Indian state of Karnataka. It has a population of more than 8 million
and a metropolitan population of around 11 million, making it the 
third most populous city and <details class="text"> <summary class="fs-3 fw-bold text-dark text-center  ">Read More</summary>fifth most populous urban agglomeration in India, as well as the largest city in South India, and the 27thlargest city in the world.[12] Located on the Deccan Plateau,
at a height of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, Bangalore
has a pleasant climate throughout the year. Its elevation is
the highest among the major cities of India.[13] Bangalore is
widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India" because of 
its role as the nation's leading information technology (IT)
exporter.[1]</details>

  <div class="col-md-12  light fw-bold  mb-4">
    The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, as found in a 
        stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, 
        Bangalore. In 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal ruler under the 
        Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort, considered the 
        foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest 
        <details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3 fw-bold text-dark ">Read More</summary>
          ,areas or petes, 
        which still exist. After the fall of the Vijayanagar empire, 
        Kempe Gowda declared independence; in 1638, a large Adil Shahi 
        Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore was given 
        to them as a jagir (feudal estate).The Mughals later captured 
        Bangalore and sold it to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), the 
        then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore.[14] When Haider Ali seized 
        control of the Kingdom of Mysore, the administration of Bangalore 
        passed into his hands.</details>

    <div class="col-md-12  light fw-bold  mb-4">
        
        The city was captured by the British East India Company after 
        victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned 
        administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. 
        The old city developed under the dominions of the Maharaja of 
        Mysore and was made capital of the Princely
        <details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3 fw-bold  text-dark">Read More</summary>
        State of Mysore, 
        which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj.
         In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, 
         outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, governed 
         as part of British India. Following India's independence in 1
         947, Bangalore became the capital of Mysore State, and remained 
          capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in
           1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore – city and 
           cantonment – which had developed as independent entities 
           merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing 
           Kannada name, Bengalūru, was declared the city's official 
           name in 2006.</details>

        Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in
         India.[15][16] Recent estimates of the metro economy of its
          urban area have ranked Bangalore either the fourth or fifth 
          most productive metro area of India.[10][17] It is home to 
          many

          The city also houses the Kannada film industry and is a hub of 
          sporting events.</details>

        Bangalore is an anglicised version of the city's Kannada 
        name Bengalūru (Kannada: ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು, Kannada pronunciation:
         [ˈbeŋɡəɭuːru] (listen)).It was the name of a village near
          Kodigehalli in Bangalore city today and was used by 
          Kempegowda to christen the city as Bangalore at the time 
          of its foundation. The earliest reference to the name 
          "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century Western Ganga 
          dynasty stone inscription on a vīra gallu (Kannada: ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು; 
          lit. 'hero stone', a rock edict extolling the virtues of a 
          warrior). According to an inscription found in Begur, 
          "Bengalūrū" was the place of a battle in 890 CE.[18][19]

    An apocryphal story states that the twelfth-century Hoysala king 
    Veera Ballala II, while on a hunting expedition, lost his way 
    in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman 
    who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place "
    Benda-Kaal-uru" (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually
     evolved into "Bengalūru".[18][20][21] Suryanath Kamath has put 
     forward an explanation of a possible floral origin of the name as 
     derived from benga, the Kannada term for Pterocarpus marsupium 
     (also known as the Indian Kino Tree), a species of dry and moist 
     deciduous trees that grows abundantly in the region.[22]

    On 11 December 2005, the Government of Karnataka accepted a 
    proposal by Jnanpith Award winner U. R. Ananthamurthy to 
    rename Bangalore to Bengalūru.[23] On 27 September 2006,
     the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) passed a 
     resolution to implement the name change.[24] The government of
      Karnataka accepted the proposal and it was decided to officially 
      implement the name change from 1 November 2006.[25][26] The 
      Union government approved this request, along with name changes 
      for 11 other Karnataka cities, in October 2014. Hence,
       Bangalore was renamed to "Bengaluru" on 1 November 2014.[27][28]

        A discovery of Stone Age artefacts during the 2001 Census of 
        India at Jalahalli, Sidhapura and Jadigenahalli, all of which are 
        located on Bangalore's outskirts today, suggest human settlement 
        around 4000 BCE.[29] Around 1,000 BCE (during the Iron Age),
         burial grounds were established at Koramangala and Chikkajala on
          the outskirts of Bangalore. Coins of the Roman emperors 
          Augustus, Tiberius, and Claudius found at Yeswanthpur and HAL

The region of modern-day Bangalore was part of several successive South 
Indian kingdoms. Between the fourth and tenth centuries, the region was 
ruled by the Western Ganga dynasty of Karnataka, the first dynasty to set
 up effective control over the region.[31] According to Edgar Thurston, 
 there were twenty-eight kings who ruled Gangavadi from the start of the 
 Christian era until its conquest by the Cholas. These kings belonged to 
 two distinct dynasties: the earlier line of the Solar race which had a 
 succession of seven kings of the Ratti 
  <details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3 text-dark fw-bold">Read More</summary>
or Reddi tribe, and the later line of the Ganga race.[32] The Western Gangas ruled the region initially
  as a sovereign power (350–550 CE), and later as feudatories of the 
  Chalukyas of Badami, followed by the Rashtrakutas until the tenth 
  century.[22] The Begur Nageshwara Temple was commissioned around 860,
   during the reign of the Western Ganga King Ereganga Nitimarga I, 
   and extended by his successor Nitimarga II.[33][34] Around 1004, 
   during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I, the Cholas defeated the 
   Western Gangas under the command of the crown prince Rajendra Chola
    I, and captured Bangalore.[33][35] During this period, the Bangalore
     region witnessed the migration of many groups—warriors, 
     administrators, traders, artisans, pastorals, cultivators, and 
     religious personnel from Tamil Nadu and other Kannada-speaking 
     regions.[31] The Chokkanathaswamy temple at Domlur, the Aigandapura 
     complex near Hesaraghatta, Mukthi Natheshwara Temple at 
     Binnamangala, Choleshwara Temple at Begur, Someshwara Temple at
      Ulsoor, date from the Chola .

     In 1117, the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana defeated the
     Cholas in the Battle of Talakad in south Karnataka, and extended 
     its rule over the region.[33] Vishnuvardhana expelled the Cholas
      from all parts of the Mysore state.[36] By the end of the 13th
       century, Bangalore became a source of contention between two 
       warring cousins, the Hoysala ruler Veera Ballala III of Halebidu 
       and Ramanatha, who administered from the Hoysala held territory 
       in Tamil Nadu.[33] Veera Ballala III had appointed a civic head 
       at  Hudi (now within Bangalore Municipal Corporation limits), 
       thus promoting the village to the status of a town. After Veera 
       Ballala III's death in 1343, the next empire to rule the region 
       <details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3 text-dark  fw-bold">Read More</summary>
      was the Vijayanagara Empire, which itself saw the rise of four 
       dynasties, the Sangamas (1336–1485), the Saluvas (1485–1491), 
       the Tuluvas (1491–1565), and the Aravidu (1565–1646).[37] During 
       the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire, Achyuta Deva Raya of the T
       uluva dynasty raised the Shivasamudra Dam across the Arkavati 
       river at Hesaraghatta, whose reservoir is the present city's 
       supply of regular piped water.

        Modern Bangalore was begun in 1537 by a vassal of the 
        Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda I, who aligned with the 
        Vijayanagara empire to campaign against Gangaraja (whom he d
        efeated and expelled to Kanchi), and who built a mud-brick fort
         for the people at the site that would become the central part 
         of modern Bangalore. Kempe Gowda was restricted by rules made 
         by Achuta Deva Raya, who feared the potential power of Kempe 
         Gowda and did not allow a formidable stone fort. Kempe Gowda 
         referred to the new town as his "gandubhūmi" or 
<details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3 text-dark  fw-bold">Read More</summary>
  "Land of Heroes
  ".[21] Within the fort, the town was divided into smaller 
  divisions, each called a pete (Kannada pronunciation: [peːteː])
  .[40]  The town had two main streets—Chikkapeté Street and
          Doddapeté Street.[41] Their intersection formed the Doddapeté 
          Square—the heart of Bangalore. Kempe Gowda I's successor, 
          Kempe Gowda II, built four towers that marked Bangalore's 
          boundary.[42] During the Vijayanagara rule, many saints and 
          poets referred to Bangalore as "Devarāyanagara" and 
          "Kalyānapura" or "Kalyānapuri" ("Auspicious City").[43]

      After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in
         1565 in the Battle of Talikota, Bangalore's rule changed 
         hands several times. Kempe Gowda declared independence, then i
         n 1638, a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army led by Ranadulla Khan 
         and accompanied by his second in command Shāhji Bhōnslē defeated
          Kempe Gowda III,[43] and Bangalore was given to Shāhji as a 
          jagir (feudal estate). In 1687, the Mughal general Kasim Khan, 
          under orders from Aurangzeb, defeated Ekoji I, son of Shāhji, 
          and sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), 
          the then ruler of 
      <details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3  text-dark fw-bold">Read More</summary>
       the Kingdom of Mysore for three lakh rupees.
        [14] After the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II in 1759, Hyder 
        Ali,Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore Army, proclaimed himself
      the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. Hyder Ali is 
      credited with building the Delhi and Mysore gates at the 
      northern and southern ends of the city in 1760.[44] 
      The kingdom later passed to Hyder Ali's son Tipu Sultan.
           Hyder and Tipu directed the building of the Lal Bagh 
           Botanical Gardens in 1760.[45] Under them, Bangalore 
           developed into a commercial and military centre of s
           trategic importance.[43]

        The Bangalore fort was captured by British forces
         under Lord Cornwallis on 21 March 1791 during the Third 
         Anglo-Mysore War and formed a centre for British resistance 
         against Tipu Sultan.[46] Following Tipu's death in the Fourth 
         Anglo-Mysore War (1799), the British returned administrative 
         control of the Bangalore pētē to the Maharaja of Mysore and was 
         incorporated into the Princely State of Mysore, which existed as
          a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj. The old pētē
           developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore.

      The
      Residency of Mysore State  was first established in Mysore 
      City in 1799 and later shifted to Bangalore in 1804.[47]
    It was abolished in 1843,  [47] only to be revived in 1881 
                at Bangalore and closed down permanently in 1947, with 
                Indian independence.[48] The British found Bangalore to be
                 a pleasant and appropriate place to station their garrison 
                 and therefore moved their cantonment to Bangalore from 
                 Seringapatam in 1809 near Ulsoor, about 6 km (4 mi) 
                 northeast of the city. A town grew up around the 
              cantonment, by absorbing several villages in the area. 
              The new centre had its own municipal and administrative 
              apparatus, though technically it was a British enclave 
              within the territory of the Wodeyar Kings of the Princely 
              State of Mysore.[49] Two important developments which 
              contributed to the rapid growth of the city, include the 
              introduction of telegraph connections to all major Indian 
              cities in 1853 and a rail connection to 
              Madras (now Chennai), in 1864.[50]

    In the 19th century, Bangalore essentially became a twin city, 
    with the "pētē", whose residents were predominantly Kannadigas 
    and the cantonment created by the British.[51] Throughout the 
    19th century, the Cantonment gradually expanded and acquired a 
    distinct cultural and political salience as it was governed 
    directly by the British and was known as the Civil and Military
     Station of Bangalore. While it remained in the princely territory 
     of Mysore, Cantonment had a large military presence and a 
     cosmopolitan

    Bangalore was hit by a plague epidemic in 1898 that claime
    d nearly 3,500 lives. The crisis caused by the outbreak catalysed the 
    city's sanitation process. Telephone lines were laid to help co-ordin
    ate anti-plague operations. Regulations for building new houses with 
    proper sanitation facilities came into effect. A health officer was 
    appointed and the city divided into four wards for better co-ordinat
    ion. Victoria Hospital was inaugurated in 1900 by Lord Curzon, the 
    then Governor-General of British India.[53] New extensions in Mall
    eswaram and 
    <details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3  text-dark fw-bold">Read More</summary>
      Basavanagudi were developed in the north and south of 
      the pētē.[54] In 1903, motor vehicles came to be introduced in 
      Bangalore.[55] In  1906, Bangalore became one of the first cities 
    in India to have electricity from hydro power, powered by the 
    hydroelectric plant situated in Shivanasamudra.[56] The Indian 
    Institute of Science was established in 1909, which subsequently 
    played a major role in developing the city as a science research 
    hub.[57] In 1912, the Bangalore torpedo, an offensive explosive 
    weapon widely used in World War I and World War II, was devised 
    in Bangalore by British army officer Captain McClintock of the 
    Madras Sappers and Miners.[58]

    Bangalore's reputation as the "Garden City of India"
     began in 1927 with the silver jubilee celebrations of the rule of
      Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. Several projects such as the construction 
      of parks, public buildings and hospitals were instituted to improve 
      the city.[2] Bangalore played an important role during the Indian 
      independence movement. Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1927 
      and 1934 and addressed public meetings here.[30] In 1926, the 
      labour unrest in Binny Mills due to demand by textile workers 
      for payment of bonus resulted in
      <details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3  text-dark fw-bold">Read More</summary>
        lathi charging and police 
      firing, resulting in the death of four workers, and several 
      injuries.[59] In July 1928, there were  notable communal 
      disturbances in Bangalore, like when a Ganesh idol was 
      removed from a school compound in the Sultanpet area of
       Bangalore.[60] In 1940, the first flight between Bangalore 
       and Bombay took off, which placed the city on India's 
       urban map.[57]

    After India's independence in August 1947, Bangalore
     remained in the newly carved Mysore State of which the Maharaja 
     of Mysore was the Rajapramukh (appointed governor).[61] The 
     "City Improvement Trust" was formed in 1945, and in 1949, the
      "City" and the "Cantonment" merged to form the Bangalore City
       Corporation.[62] The Government of Karnataka later constituted
        the Bangalore Development Authority in 1976 to coordinate the
         activities of these two bodies.[63] Public sector employment 
         and education provided opportunities for Kannadigas 
         
         <details class="text"> <summary class="fs-3  text-dark fw-bold">Read More</summary>
           from the rest of  the state to migrate to the city. Bangalore experienced 
         rapid growth in the decades 1941–51 and 1971–81, which saw the 
         arrival of many immigrants from northern Karnataka. By 1961, 
         Bangalore had become the sixth-largest city in India, with a 
         population of 1,207,000.[43] In the following decades, 
         Bangalore's manufacturing base continued to expand with the 
         establishment of private companies such as MICO (Motor Indus
         tries Company), which set up its manufacturing plant in the 
         city.[64][65]

By the 1980s, urbanisation had spilled over the 
    current boundaries, and in 1986, the Bangalore Metropolitan 
    Region Development Authority, was established to co-ordinate 
    the development of the entire region as a single unit.[63] 
    On 8 February 1981, a major fire broke out at Venus Circus 
    in Bangalore, where more than 92 people died, the majority 
    of them children.[66] Bangalore experienced a growth in its
     real estate market in the 1980s and 1990s, spurred by 
     capital investors from other parts of the country who 
     converted Bangalore's large plots and 
     <details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3  text-dark fw-bold">Read More</summary>
      colonial bungalows into multi-storied apartments.[67] In 1985, Texas Instruments
      became the first multinational corporation to set up base in 
      Bangalore. Other information technology companies followed suit 
      and by the end of the 20th century, Bangalore had established 
      itself as the Silicon Valley of India.[43] Today, Bangalore is
       India's third most populous city.[68] During the 21st century,
        Bangalore has had major terrorist attacks in 2008, 2010,

     larger Cretaceous Deccan Plateau) at an average elevation of 900 m 
     (2,953 ft).[72]: 8  It is located at 12°58′44″N 77°35′30″E and covers
      741 km2 (286 sq mi).[73] The majority of the city of Bangalore lies
       in the Bangalore Urban district of Karnataka and the surrounding 
       rural areas are a part of the Bangalore Rural district.

    the western parts of the city are hilly. The highest point is 
    Vidyaranyapura Doddabettahalli, 962 m (3,156 ft) above sea level,
     situated to the northwest of the city.[75] No major rivers run 
     through the city, although the Arkavathi and South Pennar cross 
     paths at the Nandi Hills, 60 km (37 mi) to the north. River 
     Vrishabhavathi, a minor tributary of the Arkavathi, arises 
     within the city at Basavanagudi and flows through the city. 
     The rivers Arkavathi and Vrishabhavathi together carry much of 
     Bangalore's sewage.[76][77] A sewerage system, constructed in
      1922, covers 215 km2 (83 sq mi) of the city and connects with 
      five sewage treatment centres located in the city's periphery.[78]

    In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I constructed many lakes to

    overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. 
    In the first half of the 20th century, the Nandi Hills waterworks 
    were commissioned by Sir Mirza Ismail (Diwan of Mysore, 1926–41 CE)
     to provide a water supply to the city. The river Kaveri provides 
     around 80% of the city's water supply and the remaining 20% is 
     obtained from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta reservoirs 
     of the Arkavathi river.

        The lowest ever recorded is 7.8 °C (46 °F) in January

     average.[109] Muslims comprise 13.9% of the population, roughly 
     the same as their national average. Christians and Jains account 
     for 5.6% and 1.0% of the population, respectively, double that 
     of their national averages. The city has a literacy rate of 
     89%.[110] Roughly 10% of Bangalore's population lives in 
     slums.[111]—a relatively low proportion when compared to 
     other cities in the developing world such as Mumbai (50%) and 
     Nairobi (60%).

     The 2008 National Crime Records Bureau 
     statistics indicate that Bangalore accounts for 8.5% of the

       The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, Greater Bangalore 
        Municipal Corporation) is in charge of civic administration of 
        the city. It was formed in 2007 by merging 100 wards of the 
        erstwhile Bangalore Mahanagara Palike, with seven neighbouring 
        City Municipal Councils, one Town Municipal Council and 110 
        villages around Bangalore. The number of wards increased to 
        198 in 2009.[134][135] The BBMP is run by a city council of 
        250 members, including 198 corporators representing each of 
        the wards of the city and 52 other elected  
        <details class="text "> <summary class="fs-3  text-dark fw-bold">Read More</summary>
         representatives consisting of members of Parliament and the state legislature.
         Elections to the council are held once every five years and 
         are decided by popular vote. Members contesting elections to 
         the council usually represent one or more of the state's 
         political parties. A mayor and deputy mayor are also elected 
         from the elected members of the council.[136] Elections to 
         the BBMP were held on 28 March 2010, after a gap of three and 
         a half years since the expiry of the previous elected body's 
         term, and the Bharatiya Janata Party was voted into power – 
         the first time it had ever won a civic poll in the city.[137]
          Indian National Congress councillor Sampath Raj became the
           city's mayor in September 2017; the vote was boycotted by
            the BJP.[138] In September 2018, Indian National Congress 
            councillor Gangambike Mallikarjun was elected as mayor,[139] 
            replacing Sampath Raj. In 2019 BJP's M Goutham Kumar took 
            charge as mayor. On 10 September 2020, the term of the BBMP 
            council ended and Gaurav Gupta was appointed as the 
            administrator of BBMP.[140] The municipal commissioner of
             Bangalore is Tushar Giri Nath,[141] and the police

Bangalore's rapid growth has created several 
    administrative problems relating to traffic congestion and 
    degrading infrastructure. The unplanned nature of growth 
    in the city resulted in massive traffic gridlocks; a 
    flyover system and one-way traffic systems were 
    introduced, which were only moderately successful.[143] 
    A 2003 Battelle Environmental Evaluation System (BEES) 
    evaluation of Bangalore's physical, biological and 
    socioeconomic parameters indicated that Bangalore's 
    water quality and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems

    in conjunction with the Bangalore Development 
    Authority (BDA) and the Agenda for Bangalore's

 state government, whose electorate is primarily from rural 
 Karnataka.[181] The encouragement of high-tech industry in 
 Bangalore, for example, has not favoured local employment 
 development, but instead increased land values and forced out 
 small enterprise.[182] The state has also resisted the massive 
 investments required to reverse the

    rapid decline in city 
    transport, driving new and expanding businesses elsewhere in

  fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market.[186] Forbes considers 
  Bangalore one of "The Next Decade's Fastest-Growing Cities".[187]

    As of 2022, a rapid transit system called the Namma
     Metro is being built in stages. Initially opened with the 7 km 
     (4.3 mi) stretch from Baiyappanahalli to MG Road in 2011,[201] 
     roads totaling 42.30 km (26.28 mi) for the north–south and 
     east–west lines were made operational in June 2017.[202] 
     Phase 2 of the metro covering 72.1 km (44.8 mi) is under 
     construction and includes two new lines along with the 
     extension of the existing north–south and east–west

    Buses operated by Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) 
are a staple of city public transport.[208] While commuters 
can buy tickets on boarding these buses, BMTC also provides an
 option of a bus pass to frequent users.[208] BMTC runs air-conditioned
  luxury buses on major routes and operates shuttle services from 
  various parts of the city to Kempegowda International Airport.[209]
